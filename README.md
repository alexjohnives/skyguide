## Introduction

I was a beta tester for this MMO (Massively Mulitplayer Online Game) in 2019. Having not played since it launched that same year, I revisited a couple of months ago to see how it had progressed. I discovered it had become incredibly popular with over 50 million downloads, a huge international online community and a significantly expanded virtual world to explore.

What first appealed to me about Sky, is it's a game that promotes community, kindness and friendship. For this reason it attracts a wide range of age groups, and particularly many younger players.

To progress, players have to collect light which they can trade for other in game currencies, and winged lights which they use to complete the final level of the game. For players who want to progress, they soon learn that there are patterns of play for collecting these two elements which yield the optimum results.

Winged lights in the game are at fixed locations, and there are over 100 of them. Once collected, these can be traded in once a week before the game resets on Sundays 0000 at UTC (-7hours).

Having learned that many players resort to reading game guides and watching videos, I thought that an interactive website could instead provide the optimum resource for players in locating and memorising these locations.

## Project goals

The goal of this project website is to create an interactive memory guide for the online game Sky: Children of the light.

First, I wanted to present a guide that does not spoil the content of the game, and acts more as an interactive assistive visual aid, enabling first time and more experienced users to request only the information they require.

Second, I wanted to create a site that provided engagement with the user, which promotes their experience of the game.

Thirdly, I wanted the website information to be laid out in a logical form which would facilitate players refering to it as they play.

Fourth, I plan to take an expanded version of this website live in the future, and with this in mind wished to include a functioning contact section.

Fifth, For returning users I hoped to provide a Sky reset clock and other Sky centric information they might find useful.

## User Experience (UX)

### User stories

Users will be immediately struck by how much there is to memorise in Sky, and how quickly new users can be overwhelmed. Exploring the online community, I discovered fan sites and videos which provided guides to address this need to help locate items etc, but these required sifting though lengthy text guides, or watching videos that shared game content and were also generally non specific.

I imagined as a user a tool that would serve as a memory aid, showing me a visual reference in this example for each winged light location. This would allow information to be tailored to each user's personal experience, and would help identify the gaps in their knowledge of the game.

## First Time Visitor

As a First Time Visitor:

1. I want my first impression of the site's design to be positive and to be on brand with the overarching themes of the game, which are colourful, welcoming and positive.

2. I want the site purpose and use to be immediatly clear, with the emphasis being on getting the information I require.

3. I want to easily understand the content and find it engaging.

4. I would like to feel that the information is informative and enhancing my experience with the Sky game and community.

## Returning and Frequent Visitor requirements and expectations

As a Returning and Frequent visitor:

1. Most important is that I can quickly locate the information I require.

2. That I can contact the site to make suggestions, provide feedback or request content.

3. That the site is provided by a fan of the game who is familiar with the nomenclature and game culture.

## Design Choices - Inspirations

My immediate inspiration for the website was the game itself, which is visually stunning. It also resonates with me like its predessor Journey, which clearly has an Asian cultural influence incorporating Buddist iconography and architecture, traditional East Asian styings and anime. As a master's graduate in Chinese with over a decade living and working in East Asia, there is an aesthetic to the game that is both immediate and familiar to me.

## Design

Perhaps because of this combined with the source material, I immediately had a clear vision for how I wanted my site to look. I utilised the game logo, images from the game and a sky blue to white gradient for my wireframes drawn up in the IOS app Procreate.

I modifyed the logo with the additon of the word 'guide' in a warm orange, which I took inspiration for from my game avatar's kimono cape.

Together with the blue to white gradiant for the background to reflect a blue sky, I felt the wireframes immediatly achieved a design foundation I was satisfied with.

![Skyguide wireframe 2](https://github.com/alexjohnives/skyguide/blob/master/assets/images/wireframe2.jpg)

From the outset I decided I wanted to use a HTML/ CSS responsive framework. I explored [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) but settled on Bootstrap 5 instead as I am already familiar with the framework from my first project.

### Colors

I decided on keeping my design clean and concise. Rather than importing my background gradient from Procreate, I found an online tool [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/) to create the background.

For the other colours of the website I referred to the game and used the Google extension [Eye Dropper](https://eyedropper.org/) to take colour references. I then modified these in Procreate and approached the colour styings for this project using my own judgment. These can be seen in the area logos I created to add a more personal element to the site.

### Typography

I referred to the game website [Sky: Children of the light](https://thatgamecompany.com/sky/) and liked their use of the google font Lato, which I paired with Roboto for the website text. Sans Serif was selected as the fallback font.

### Icons

Utilising bootstrap in the creation of this site I used their newly released Bootstrap Icons v1.4.0 package [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/), but have only used one icon for the scroll to top page function.

## Images and Photo Media

With a couple of exceptions, all the images and movie elements utilised in this project were taken by me using the in game photo and film capture options.

The winged art image on the front page was created by PlagueDoctorJed who gave permission for its use in this site.

## Languages Used

HTML5

CSS

Javascript

## Tools, Frameworks, Libraries and Programs used

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Version 1.55.2 was used as code editor. I cloned my Github repository and pushed most of my work from this environment.

[Procreate](https://procreate.art/): I've found this app invaluable for creating the website wireframes, image editing and logos for this project.

[Bootstrap 5.0.0 Beta 3](https://getbootstrap.com): I used the latest release of Bootstrap to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website. I discovered that it was so new documentation about new features was sometimes limited. I did however refer a great deal to the Bootstrap 5 website documentation and examples.

[Bootstrap Icons v1.4.0](https://icons.getbootstrap.com): Bootstrap’s own icon set was employed for the scroll to top icon.

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.ca/intl/en_ca/chrome/): Google Chrome’s browser inspect feature was used to check website responsiveness and error check javascript code.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com): Lato and Roboto were imported to the document’s header via links and referenced in CSS.

[Git](https://www.gitpod.io): Was used when contacting student support and for version control.

[Github](https://github.com/): Used to store the project code pushed from Git.

[Apple Quicktime](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/quicktime-player/welcome/mac): Quicktime was used for video editing and primarily removing audio from recorded content.

Apple Preview- Used for photo editing
